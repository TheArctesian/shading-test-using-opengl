Hello! This is a git repo for me to learn and just be a kinda test playground for js 

8/12/21

Using vite and 3js 

Testing 3d js using three js and messing with shading
run the following command
    - npm install -g npm (for first time npm users) 
    - npm run dev 
*vite already in json*

should run on local host 3000 or som 

Also using vim for the first time to write the readme, but not brave enough to port it to vscode

Vim is easy
